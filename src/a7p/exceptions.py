"""
This module defines custom error classes, data classes, and utility functions for
handling validation violations in the A7P project. It includes various types of
violations, error handling, and logic for extracting violations from protocol
buffers related to validation.

Classes:
    Violation: Represents a violation with a specific path, value, and reason.
    ProtoViolation: Represents a violation extracted from protocol buffer data.
    SpecViolation: Represents a specification-related violation.
    A7PError: Base class for all A7P-related errors.
    A7PDataError: A subclass of A7PError related to data issues.
    A7PChecksumError: A subclass of A7PDataError for checksum-related errors.
    A7PValidationError: A subclass of A7PDataError for validation-related errors.
    A7PProtoValidationError: A subclass of A7PValidationError for protocol validation errors.
    A7PSpecValidationError: A subclass of A7PValidationError for specification validation errors.
    A7PSpecTypeError: A subclass of A7PDataError for errors related to specification type mismatches.

Functions:
    _extract_violation: Extracts a violation from an expression_pb2.Violation object.
    _extract_protovalidate_violations: Extracts a list of ProtoViolation from an expression_pb2.Violations object.
